Sup is a recommendation engine chatbot that connects you with the most happening (“buzzing") venues in your locale.

### How It Works
Starting a dialog with Sup? is as easy as sending the word "sup" through one of the available channels (SMS,FB Messenger). The Sup? bot will inquire which location you are looking for and let you know if there are any buzzing venues that you might want to check out.

### Open Source TODO’s
1. **City validation** (known error), returns error when non-city string is entered in second part of dialog*
2. **Cards** , return  ore detailed venue information*
3. **Geospatial suggestions**, build a richer suggestion engine, possibly with another venues-like API*
